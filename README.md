# Project on Top 5 Europe Football Leagues 2014 - 2020

Emotions and team spirit are as much a part of football as technique and plan. The formation of the team is an important consideration in team tactics. During the period of 2014-20, the top five European football leagues were taken into consideration. There was an investigation of the dataset's properties such as, Games Information and Shots struck by the players as well as team stats and appearance information. Skill moves, Pace, Shooting, Strength Stamina Physics Passing Movement Mentality and other Football-related abilities define each football player. 

We compared these characteristics since they are critical to a successful team selection. Based on the user-defined information, an algorithm is used to choose the best players for the user-defined configuration and to identify the best teams. Systematic examination of the top five European league football data sets reveals that it improves team organization. Finding the greatest teams and players may be aided by this method and its analytical outcomes.
